  summary: I took part in AI Hack Tunisia 2019 – Africa and the Middle East’s largest AI hackathon to date – hosted from 20-22nd September. I've made it with my partner dataSparkles to the second round of the Startup competition, we've gained a new experience from this one and I'm sure one day we're gonna win!

  summary: I graduated from ESPRIT as a data science Engineer with honours of the jury. I got the chance to be mentored by amazing individuals who believed in me and made me think differently. I enjoyed every minute of personal hard work, group projects, and on-campus activities.
