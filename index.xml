Over the last years, state-of-the-art Deep Learning models are highly effective in solving many complex real-world problems â€” boosting progress in computer vision and natural language processing and impacting nearly every industry. However, these models are vulnerable to well-designed input samples called adversarial examples.
With the advance in AI systems, most companies are focusing on increasing AI performance rather than quality and safety.</description></item><item><title>The Far Side of AI: Neuro-Symbolic AI</title><link>https://GhadaJouini.github.io/posts/blog1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://GhadaJouini.github.io/posts/blog1/</guid><description>Key Words: Symbolic AI, Deep Learning, Neuro-Symbolic AI
Introduction Artificial Intelligence( AI ) has been witnessing a monumental growth in bridging the gap between the capabilities of humans and machines.
Building thinking machines have been a human obsession for decades. Despite, the current advances in AI and ML, concerns about trust, safety, interpretability, and accountability of AI were raised by influential thinkers. In this article, we will discover the next wave of AI systems by introducing the Neuro-Symbolic AI approach.</description></item><item><title>Search Results</title><link>https://GhadaJouini.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://GhadaJouini.github.io/search/</guid><description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
